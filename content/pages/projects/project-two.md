Doctor LRP is an advanced Explainable AI (XAI) tool designed to assist healthcare professionals in understanding and verifying diagnostic predictions. The system leverages Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to provide detailed explanations for its predictions, ensuring transparency and trust in AI-assisted healthcare.

Key Features:

1.  **Prediction with Explanation**: After making a prediction, Doctor LRP employs LRP to highlight which regions of the medical scan contributed most to the prognosis.

2.  **Object Detection**: The system incorporates object detection to identify and outline (using bounding boxes) the precise location of abnormalities, providing a clear "what and where" for detected issues.

3.  **Datasets and Testing**: Doctor LRP was rigorously tested on two datasets:

    *   **Brain Tumor Dataset**: To identify and explain brain tumor regions.

    *   **Bone Fracture Dataset**: To detect and localize fractures in bone scans.

4.  **Accuracy**: Achieved an impressive 93% accuracy across both datasets, demonstrating its reliability and effectiveness.

This tool not only empowers doctors with actionable insights but also bridges the gap between AI predictions and human decision-making by ensuring the reasoning behind every diagnosis is transparent and interpretable.
