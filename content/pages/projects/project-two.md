  An Explainable AI (XAI)-powered tool that not only analyzes medical scans but
  also spills the beans on why it thinks something’s wrong. It even gives
  doctors a nudge through their portal—because AI can’t just diagnose, it has to
  overachieve with transparency and sass.

Doctor LRP is an advanced Explainable AI (XAI) tool designed to assist healthcare professionals in understanding and verifying diagnostic predictions. The system leverages Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to provide detailed explanations for its predictions, ensuring transparency and trust in AI-assisted healthcare.

Key Features:

1.  **Prediction with Explanation**: After making a prediction, Doctor LRP employs LRP to highlight which regions of the medical scan contributed most to the prognosis.

2.  **Object Detection**: The system incorporates object detection to identify and outline (using bounding boxes) the precise location of abnormalities, providing a clear "what and where" for detected issues.

3.  **Datasets and Testing**: Doctor LRP was rigorously tested on two datasets:

    *   **Brain Tumor Dataset**: To identify and explain brain tumor regions.

    *   **Bone Fracture Dataset**: To detect and localize fractures in bone scans.

4.  **Accuracy**: Achieved an impressive 93% accuracy across both datasets, demonstrating its reliability and effectiveness.

This tool not only empowers doctors with actionable insights but also bridges the gap between AI predictions and human decision-making by ensuring the reasoning behind every diagnosis is transparent and interpretable.
