  Imagine a security system so smart, it spots trouble before your nosy neighbor
  does. With real-time alerts, location tracking, and even a friendly Telegram
  message to authorities, this project is the ultimate tattletale for crime.
  Plus, it works just as well at night—because criminals don’t respect bedtime!
