### **The Problem**

In the fast-paced world of financial journalism, platforms like Bloomberg Terminal are flooded with articles every day. While factual news is critical for market decisions, editorial and opinion pieces often add noise. Identifying and separating editorial content is essential to improve the user experience and ensure precise financial analysis.



### **Our Solution**

To tackle this, we developed an NLP-based framework to classify financial news articles into two categories: Regular (factual) and Non-Regular (opinion, editorial). Our approach leverages advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to handle linguistic nuances and overcome the challenges of imbalanced datasets.



### **Our Approach**

1.  **Data Collection and Preparation**:

    *   We worked with data from 95 prominent news sources, focusing primarily on articles from 2018–2019.

    *   Categories like op-eds, editorials, and opinions were merged into a single "Non-Regular" class, addressing the dataset's inherent imbalance.

    *   Preprocessing included cleaning text, removing irrelevant elements, and extracting key linguistic features.

2.  **Feature Engineering**:

    *   We extracted attributes like sentiment scores (VADER), grammatical structures (POS tags), and text patterns to enrich the dataset.

    *   Entity recognition and feature correlation analysis revealed unique differences between Regular and Non-Regular articles.

3.  **Model Development**:

    *   Starting from Logistic Regression as a baseline, we trained models like Decision Trees, LightGBM, and deep learning architectures such as BiLSTMs, BERT, and XLNet.

    *   For BERT and XLNet, we tested different configurations and sequence lengths (64–512 words) to optimize performance.

4.  **Evaluation and Validation**:

    *   Metrics like Macro F1 Score and Matthews Correlation Coefficient ensured fair evaluation despite class imbalances.

    *   Zero-shot testing with data from a Canadian news source validated the models’ ability to generalize across unseen datasets.



### **Key Achievements**

1.  **Performance**:

    *   XLNet and BERT emerged as the top performers, with Macro F1 Scores of 0.930 and 0.932, respectively.

    *   Even Logistic Regression with TF-IDF performed competitively, offering a resource-efficient alternative for lower computational setups.

2.  **Generalization**:

    *   The models successfully classified articles from unseen sources, proving their adaptability to new datasets with lexical and topical differences.

3.  **Insights**:

    *   Regular articles leaned heavily on facts, reflected by higher mentions of numbers and proper nouns.

    *   Non-Regular articles showed greater use of descriptive elements like adjectives and adverbs, highlighting their opinionated nature.



### **Why This Matters**

Our work bridges the gap between content curation and financial analysis, making it easier for professionals to focus on actionable insights. Beyond finance, this framework can pave the way for detecting media bias, misinformation, and sentiment trends across industries.



### **What’s Next?**

1.  **Multi-Class Classification**:
    We aim to refine classification further by distinguishing subcategories like op-eds, editorials, and guest pieces.

2.  **Paragraph-Level Analysis**:
    By diving deeper, we want to differentiate factual and opinionated content within individual articles.

3.  **Sentiment and Topic Analysis**:
    Exploring emotional tones and trending topics in financial news will add an additional layer of insight.

4.  **Fake News Detection**:
    Using similar methodologies, we plan to expand into identifying misinformation and political bias in media.



This work demonstrates the power of NLP and AI in addressing real-world challenges in journalism, improving precision, and ensuring the integrity of financial news consumption.
